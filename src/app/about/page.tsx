                Hi, I am Tereza. I love trying new things — from fitness classes to food pop-ups. I used ClassPass for years and kept thinking there should be something like it for hobbies. Dabble came from that idea. I wanted a way for people to try creative classes, meet others in real life, and fill free time with meaningful, joyful experiences. I hope Dabble helps you discover something new and connect with people who share your passions.
